**Overview**

This project is a React application that displays a list of students using React components and props. Each student is shown on a student card with their name, department, and year.

**App.jsx:**

Renders multiple Student components, each with different student details.

Passes rollNo, name, dept, and year as props.

**Student.jsx:**

A reusable React component that displays student information.

Uses PropTypes for type validation of props.

**What I Learned**

Component Reusability: Created a Student component and reused it multiple times in App.jsx.

Props Handling: Passed dynamic student data through props.

Using PropTypes: Ensured type safety for the props (e.g., rollNo must be a number).

List Rendering in React: Displayed multiple student entries in a structured format.
