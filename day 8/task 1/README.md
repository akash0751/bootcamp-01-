**Overview**

This project is a simple React application that displays a greeting message "Hello Akash!!" using JSX. It imports a CSS file (App.css) for styling and follows the standard React component structure.

**What I Learned**

JSX Syntax: Writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

React Components: Creating a functional component (App).

CSS Styling: Importing and applying styles from App.css.

Exporting Components: Using export default App to make the component reusable.
