**Overview**

This script demonstrates file handling with Promises. It reads a file (input.txt), converts its content to uppercase, and writes the result to output.txt.

**What I Learned**

Using fs.promises for asynchronous file operations.
Promise chaining (then() and catch()).
Converting text using JavaScript string methods.
