Overview:
This project is a user registration form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple and elegant interface for users to sign up with validation for email and password fields.

What I Learned:
HTML form handling: Structuring form elements with labels and inputs.
CSS styling: Applying box-shadow, border-radius, and hover effects for a visually appealing design.
JavaScript validation: Using regular expressions for email validation and condition-based checks for password security.
User experience improvements: Providing real-time error messages.
