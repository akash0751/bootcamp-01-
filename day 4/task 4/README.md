Overview:
This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

What I Learned:
HTML structuring: Creating a functional calculator layout.
CSS styling: Using grid-template-columns for button organization.
JavaScript event handling: Capturing button clicks and updating the display.
Evaluation of expressions: Using eval() to calculate results dynamically.
