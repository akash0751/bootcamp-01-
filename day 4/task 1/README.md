Overview:
This project is a simple interactive webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to show and hide text by clicking buttons.

What I Learned:
HTML structuring: Using h1, p, and button elements for content organization.
CSS styling: Custom button styling with border-radius and background colors.
JavaScript DOM manipulation: Using getElementById to dynamically show/hide elements.
Event handling: Implementing onClick events to trigger JavaScript functions.
