Overview:
This project is a temperature converter built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit dynamically.

What I Learned:
HTML form handling: Creating input fields for user temperature conversion.
CSS styling with Bootstrap: Using Bootstrap for modern design and responsiveness.
JavaScript calculations: Implementing mathematical conversions dynamically.
Event handling: Adding onclick functionality for real-time updates.
