Overview:
This project is a simple pop-up message system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a modal-style message when the user clicks a button and allows them to close it.


What I Learned:
HTML structuring: Creating a modal-like pop-up with div elements.
CSS styling: Implementing opacity effects for smooth pop-up transitions.
JavaScript DOM manipulation: Using addEventListener to handle button clicks.
Event handling: Attaching functions to display and hide elements dynamically.
