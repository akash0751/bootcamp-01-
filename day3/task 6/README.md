Overview:
This project is a simple interactive to-do list built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, mark as completed, and remove tasks dynamically.

What I Learned:
HTML structuring: Creating an interactive task list with ul and li elements.
JavaScript DOM manipulation: Adding and removing tasks dynamically.
CSS styling: Using text-decoration: line-through; for completed tasks.
Event handling: Capturing clicks for task completion and removal.
