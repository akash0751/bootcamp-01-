Overview:
This project is a simple timer/stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer that counts seconds, minutes, and hours.

What I Learned:
JavaScript time management: Using setInterval() and clearInterval().
HTML button event handling: Implementing onclick functions.
CSS styling: Creating a centered, clean interface.
String formatting: Using padStart() to maintain 00:00:00 format.
