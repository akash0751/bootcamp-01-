Overview:
This project is a simple image slider built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to navigate through a set of images using previous and next buttons.

What I Learned:
HTML structuring: Creating an image slider using div elements.
CSS animations: Using transition and transform for smooth sliding effects.
JavaScript event handling: Implementing click events for navigation.
DOM manipulation: Changing the transform property to slide images dynamically
